          <p className="text-center text-gray-dark sm:text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-relaxed">
            Green Coffee was born from a simple but powerful idea: great coffee should be both delicious and
            responsible. Our journey started with a deep appreciation for the art of coffee-making and a desire to make
            a positive impact on the industry. As coffee lovers, we knew that the best brews come from carefully
            cultivated beans, grown with care and harvested with integrity. We built Green Coffee on a foundation of
            sustainability and transparency, sourcing only the finest green coffee beans from farmers who prioritize
            ethical and eco-friendly practices. From small, family-run farms to renowned estates, we ensure that every
            stepâ€”from cultivation to roastingâ€”is done with precision and passion. Today, we continue to push the
            boundaries of what great coffee can be. We invite you to be part of our journeyâ€”one that celebrates quality,
            sustainability, and the simple joy of a well-brewed cup. Because at Green Coffee, every sip tells a story.
